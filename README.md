## 001 Claw & Order: All Things Cats 
**Description:** Project I have to make to evaluate my skills as a devloper (yikes).
<hr>
Gonna use the README as a way to journal this whole experience, so let's just see how this goes.

### Goal 1: Setup Project in VSCode
- Shouldn't take too long...and finished
  - Had to unistall and reinstall `npx create-react-app`
  - Made the React App inside a temporary directory, then moved all of those contents into the main project directory.
  - Commit Name -> `Boiler Plate`
- Installed some extensions to make life easy
  - ESLint
  - npm Intellisense

### Goal 2: Get a single fetch request, display all Information
- So we need to figure out how to use this XState library to fetch our desired data
  - installed using `npm i xstate @xstate/react`
  - figuring the xstate stuff out real quick hold on...
